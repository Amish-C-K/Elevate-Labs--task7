### 5. Identified Suspicious/Unused Extensions  
Marked the following extensions as suspicious or unnecessary based on poor reviews, excessive permissions, and lack of usage:

| Extension Name       | Status        | Reason for Removal                                      |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| PDF Converter Pro    | ‚ùå Removed     | Unknown source, poor reviews, requested excessive access |
| Weather Now          | ‚ùå Removed     | Injected ads, unfamiliar developer, flagged by users     |

### 5. Removed Extensions  
Used Chrome's built-in remove option to uninstall the flagged extensions.

### 6. Restarted Chrome  
Fully closed and relaunched the browser. Noted improvement in performance:
- Faster load times
- No more ad popups or redirect behavior

## üîç Research: How Malicious Extensions Harm Users

Malicious browser extensions can:
- **Track browsing activity** and sell data
- **Steal login credentials** through content injection
- **Redirect search results** and insert ads
- **Act as spyware or adware**
- Receive updates that **silently convert them into malware**

### üîê Best Practices Going Forward
- Only install extensions from **verified developers**
- Regularly audit your installed extensions
- Check permissions before and after installation
- Stay updated on cybersecurity trends

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- Removed 2 suspicious extensions
- Improved browser performance and security awareness
- Gained practical experience with browser extension management

---

## üìå Summary

This exercise highlighted the importance of maintaining a clean and secure browsing environment by actively managing browser extensions. Even commonly used browsers like Chrome can become vulnerable through third-party extensions, emphasizing the need for regular audits.
